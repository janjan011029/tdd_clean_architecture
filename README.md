# Flutter TDD Clean Architecture

A Flutter project demonstrating Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Clean Architecture principles. This project serves as a practical implementation of software engineering best practices in Flutter development.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was created to demonstrate and improve understanding of:
- Clean Architecture implementation in Flutter
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology
- SOLID principles
- Unit Testing best practices
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## 🏗️ Architecture
